<h1>Hello, World</h1>
<br>
Project done during <h3>Full Stack Software Engineering</h3> studies at <h3>ALX School</h3>. It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in C language.

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4</li>
<li>Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Files</h2>
<br>
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

<tr>
<th>Filename</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>



0-preprocessor	Runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file

1-compiler		Compiles a C file but does not link

2-assembler	Generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file

3-name		Compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun

4-puts.c		Prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"

5-printf.c		Prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art

6-size.c		Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled

100-intel		Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file

101-quote.c	Prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19
