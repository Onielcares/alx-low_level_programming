<h1>Hello, World</h1>
<br>
Project done during <strong>Full Stack Software Engineering</strong> studies at <strong>ALX School</strong>. It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in C language.

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4</li>
<li>Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Files</h2>
<br>
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

<tr>
<td>0-preprocessor</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>1-compiler</td>	
<td>Compiles a C file but does not link</td>

</tr>

<tr>
